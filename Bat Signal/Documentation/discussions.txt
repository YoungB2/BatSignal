BatSignal Discussion topics (Finalizing the SDD):
	Design Constraints:
		- What assumptions do we make?
		- What other constraints might we face? (Processing, memory, communication, etc.)
	
	Project References:
		- Does the speech-to-text library have a reference web page we can link?
		- Who makes the microphone, and do  they have a web page we can link?
